Creates an quickbooks-importable .iif file from an amazon payments .csv.

Amazon Payments doesn't export iif.

This is pretty jank.  It was useful for me.  Might save you some time.

We needed to use this to import a bunch of people off Kickstarter.com (which uses amazon payments).  As a 501(c)3 non-profit, we need to track donors individually, so being able to import this data into quickbooks is really helpful.
